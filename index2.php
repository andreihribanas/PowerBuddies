				<p id="common_section_content">PowerBuddies strives on developing and maintaining our loyal customer base. By being such a niche business, we open a new gap within 
                                    the market where eco-friendly enthusiasts seek. One of the main reasons why consumers consider PowerBuddies such a viable option, in 
                                    particular students, is due to the solar energy benefiting the consumer by not having to pay any additional costs to gain power and the
                                    convenience to take our product wherever they may go. </p> <br />
                                
                                <p id="common_section_content">Customer incentives is essential to PowerBuddies as we have an incentives programme that runs across the year. We offer discounts, such as 
                                    money off bulk-purchases and a reward system for those who have opened up a membership with us. Priority is given to members who will 
                                    receive updates on products first.  Thus, we will be a big threat to our competitors as we provide innovative products, quality service 
                                    and support. We feel that we should keep improving service and support for customers which should ultimately make us differ from our market.</p> <br />

                                <p id="common_section_content">We currently stand as one of the only energy generating businesses which uses artificial light to power devices, therefore we instantaneously 
                                    attract an immense market. We don’t just want to save money and time for customers but we want our customers to be fully satisfied, as we
                                    provide troubleshooting support free of charge for one year. We take pride in providing the best customer service for our customers whom 
                                    should feel the proficiency of majestic service from our efforts to communicate with consumers.</p> <br />

                                <p id="common_section_content">Our target audience is focused towards those who are on the go and dependent on their phones to get them through the day. Students would
                                    benefit from this because it’s affordable, portable and it does not require electrical external sources to recharge the phones during their 
                                    busy schedules at university. In addition, the time saved by not relying on power sockets to recharge devices, allows business people to 
                                    charge their phones whilst attending to their everyday business. </p> <br />
